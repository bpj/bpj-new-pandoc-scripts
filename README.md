# bpj-pandoc-scripts

My [Pandoc][]-related (Perl) scripts.  Most of them are filters built with [Pandoc::Elements][].

You can read [documentation][doc] for the scripts in (Pandoc/GitHub) Markdown format.
The `.pl` files generally contain the same documentation in POD format.

There is a [separate file][installation] with installation instructions and some info
for those who are new to Perl and/or to Pandoc JSON-based filters.

[Pandoc::Elements]: https://metacpan.org/release/Pandoc-Elements
[doc]: doc/markdown_pandoc
[installation]: INSTALLING-filters.md
